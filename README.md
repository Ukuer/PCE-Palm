## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting Started ###

### Installation
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ukuer/PCE-Palm.git
cd PCE-Palm
``` 
- Install dependencies:
`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`
- More details:
This code borrows heavily from the [RPG-Palm](https://github.com/Ukuer/RPG-Palm) repository. 
You can find more details about the original code in the [RPG-Palm](https://github.com/Ukuer/RPG-Palm).

### Use a Pre-trained Model
- Download [pce-checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1epH7GV3g9fk4_RwOX8x-uMo5iKOlj0I4/view?usp=sharing), unzip it and place it in `./checkpoints `.
- Download [CUT-checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r_1vdrVaqrBjuBktBKaj5fEwIXzbka8s/view?usp=sharing), unzip it and place it in `./CUT/checkpoints `.

- Then `bash ./inference.sh`. Noted that you should modify some contents in `./inference.sh` to meet you requirements.

## Model Training
### Tools
- The proposed PCEM can be found in `./PCEM_numpy.py`. You can use it to get the PCE images from palmprint ROIs.
- The propsoed LFEB can be found in `./LFEM_pytorch.py`. You can add it in your network.
- The improved bezier curves can be found in `./syn_bezier.py`. 

### Training 
Our proposed method is a two-stage method. 
The first stage is train a modified CUT model with bezier curves images and PCE images. 
The second stage is to train a generation model with paired PCE images and real palmprints.

- To train a modified CUT model:
    - Firstly, extract PCE images from palmprint ROIs using `./PCEM_numpy.py`.
    - Then, genrate bezier curves images using `./syn_bezier.py`, with a equal number of PCE images.
    - Finally, train a modified CUT model. You can find more details from [CUT](https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation.git) origin repository.
    - Noted that set `--netG resnet_9blocks_lfeb`.

- To train a generation model:
    - Train the model with paired PCE images and real palmprints.
    - Then, `bash run.sh`.
    - To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097. To see more intermediate results, check out  `./checkpoints/NAME/web/index.html`. See [RPG-Palm](https://github.com/Ukuer/RPG-Palm) for more details.
    - Noted that we use the augmentation module from [Stylegan2-ADA](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada). If you have any dependencies issues, please refer to the [Stylegan2-ADA](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada) repository.
